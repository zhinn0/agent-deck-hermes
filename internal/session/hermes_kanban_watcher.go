// KanbanWatcher reads Hermes Kanban state directly from ~/.hermes/kanban.db,
// the same SQLite file the Hermes CLI, dashboard plugin, and gateway notifier
// all read from. It does NOT speak HTTP or WebSocket — the dashboard plugin's
// own /events WebSocket is itself just a poll-and-relay over this same table.
// Reading directly removes a network hop, an authentication dependency, and a
// process dependency (the dashboard does not need to be running).
//
// The watcher seeds counts from the `tasks` table and then tails the
// append-only `task_events` table on a short interval, applying each event
// through a small state machine that mirrors Hermes's own event semantics.
//
// Concurrency model:
//
//   - All public methods are safe to call from any goroutine.
//   - Two locks: w.mu (RWMutex) guards count/status/cursor/cache fields;
//     w.subsMu (Mutex) guards the subscribers slice. They are NEVER held
//     simultaneously: notify() is always invoked after w.mu.Unlock() so a
//     future subscriber callback that reaches back into the watcher cannot
//     deadlock.
//   - Two goroutine sources: one long-lived pollLoop started by Start();
//     and at most one short-lived cache-refresh goroutine spawned by
//     maybeRefreshCache when Counts/TaskStatus is called on an unhealthy
//     watcher. ForceRefreshCache runs inline on the caller's goroutine and
//     does not participate in that bound — callers are expected not to
//     stampede (in practice, a single Bubble Tea Cmd).
//   - Start and Stop are idempotent. Stop does not wait for an in-flight
//     cache-refresh goroutine — that goroutine self-cancels within ~3s via
//     exec.CommandContext, and its final applyCacheResult is harmless
//     (subscribers nil, fields unread).

// records who wrote last so a late-arriving cache refresh cannot clobber
// SQLite-authoritative values.
